# Tensorflow Developer Certificate Preparation (ML Notebooks)


## Description

<p>This is a collection of different ML notebooks I've done to prepare for the Tensorflow Developer Certification.</p>
Most of these projects follow the same structure: I found a Kaggle dataset that fits the ML topic, prepared the data, and compared different model performances (preferably in TF).
