# Machine Learning Notebooks


## Description

<p>This is a collection of different ML notebooks I've written to prepare for the Tensorflow Developer Certification.</p>
Most of these projects follow the same structure: I found a Kaggle dataset that fits the ML topic, prepared the data, and compared different model performances (preferably in TF). 

Each notebook is a project on its own, utilizing other Kaggle notebooks and contributions.

Not all topics are directly related to the Tensorflow Developer Certificate Exam, sometimes the notebooks include other ML concepts I found useful.
